Meteor + SpreadJS V1.0
=========
----
This application is a combination of meteor and spreadjs, a first of its kind application in meteor. 

> The overriding design goal of this application is to combine the reactive
> nature of meteor and the high performance HTML5 spreadjs to ensure real time data
> syncing and a better User Experience for its users.
> This application gives a total different look and feel to spreadjs and we encourage
> meteor developers to use this application for smoother data handling on the client side.

To test **real time data syncing** one can open the application in multiple tabs and enter data to check.
